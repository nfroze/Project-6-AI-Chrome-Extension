# Privacy Policy - LinkedIn Shitpost Detector

**Last Updated: July 2025**

## We Don't Collect Any Data. Period.

- No personal information
- No browsing history  
- No tracking or cookies
- No data storage
- No accounts needed

## How It Works

When you click "Get TLDR Roast":
1. We copy text from that post
2. Send it to Claude AI
3. Show you the result
4. Delete everything immediately

Each roast is anonymous. We don't know who you are or what you're roasting.

## Important Note

We only analyse publicly visible LinkedIn posts - the same content anyone can already see on LinkedIn. We never access private messages, connections, or profile data.

## Permissions

- **activeTab**: To read the post when you click
- **linkedin.com**: To add roast buttons

## Third Parties

We use Claude AI to generate roasts.
