# Privacy Policy - LinkedIn Shitpost Detector

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## We Don't Collect Any Data. Period.

- No personal information
- No browsing history  
- No tracking or cookies
- No data storage
- No accounts needed

## How It Works

When you click "Roast":
1. We read ONLY that specific post's text
2. Send it to AI for roasting
3. Show you the result
4. Delete everything immediately

Each roast is anonymous. We don't know who you are or what you're roasting.

## Permissions

- **activeTab**: To read the post when you click
- **linkedin.com**: To add roast buttons

## Third Parties

We use Claude AI to generate roasts. Neither we nor they store any data.
