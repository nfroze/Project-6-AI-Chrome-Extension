# Privacy Policy - LinkedIn Shitpost Detector

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Overview
LinkedIn Shitpost Detector is a Chrome extension that generates humorous summaries of LinkedIn posts. We take privacy seriously and collect NO personal data.

## What Happens When You Click "Roast"
1. The extension reads ONLY the text of that specific LinkedIn post
2. The text is sent to our server for processing
3. Our server sends it to Claude AI to generate a roast
4. The roast is displayed to you
5. Everything is immediately deleted - nothing is stored

## Data Usage

- Each request is anonymous and isolated
- We don't know who you are or what posts you're roasting
